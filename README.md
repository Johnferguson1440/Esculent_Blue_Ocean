# Esculent_Blue_Ocean
# Readme template 
(est time: 2+ hours)
An extremely important part of your Blue Ocean project is the readme.md that accompanies your code repository.
It is recommended that you *start* the readme.md during the sprint, and complete it afterwards.
You should replace the existing readme.md in your repo with the following information:
## Catchy headline / cool graphic
## Who are the contributors (names should link to their github or portfolio page)
    * Benjamin Jackson- https://github.com/bustlingbenjamin
    * John Ferguson- https://github.com/Johnferguson1440
    * Larry Pruitt- https://github.com/lpruiettjr
    * Jinsik Kim- https://github.com/rlawlstlr93
## Introduction
This project was a brief 1-week sprint where our team tried to complete an MVP for an external user **(Jane Doe)**
 - Add any additional content here pertaining to timeline, any personal goals, etc
## What does the app do? 
    * What problem does it solve? Who uses it?
    * This APP allows you to build a daily meal planner based off of intolerances, nutrients, and ingredients.
    * Why was it built?
    * To help a Mother-To-Be ensure she was making her daily consumption of nutrients daily.(And to help her come up with ne recipes to try..)
    * User Inputs and Outputs
    * Inputs- Intolerances, Nutrients, Ingredients...
    * Outputs- Recipes to select for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
## Tech stack ( you can include logos)
## Technical Challenges and research that you anticipated
    * Building routes for our MongoDB server in seperate JS files based on what they needed to do.

    Why, what was the plan to overcome those challenges?
    * What did you learn?
## Challenges that were unexpected
    * Rendering a string of HTML tags in React.
        If not set correctly it will show all HTML tags as string values. To help alleviate the problem we unfortunately had to set the inner HTMl. This is not best practice and will prolly try to reformat to use a library instead.

    * What did you learn?
## Video Demo / Screen shot walkthrough of the app 
    * What were the user stories /  what was MVP (mention Minimal Viable Product)
## How does the app work?
    * What happens behind the scenes when the user interacts with it? 
    * OR What are all the place the data travels?  What happens to that data?
    * Optionally include a diagram
    * How does the tech stack come together?
## What research was required?
## Workflow and Key lessons from your team - specifically those related to: Agile, CI/CD, testing, working with external stakeholders, ticketing, and user stories.
    * Your git workflow, style guides, commit guides, etc
    * What did you learn from the process
    * What were key takeaways from stand ups, code reviews, etc
    * Writing tests
    * Link to your trello board, discuss completed tickets
## Any non-MVP tickets (optional)
 - Code refactorings
 - Performance Optimizations
 - Additional features
 - etc
## Notes from your Sprint Retro
## What additional features do you plan to add, how do you plan to implement those features?
    * Future refactoring?
    * Additional dev ops considerations?
    * UI/UX additions?
